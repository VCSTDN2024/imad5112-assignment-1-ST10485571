2. Project Overview
-------------------

Project Overview
The "MEAL SUGGESTION APP" is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD5112 subject. This application was created using Kotlin and Android Studio. The app's primary purpose is to help people expand their daily meal options and improve their normal diets by suggesting meals depending on the time of day.  

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

3. App Purpose and Features
---------------------------

Purpose and Features

Purpose:
Purpose: The main goal of this app is to help users expand their meal options and discover new food choices. It's designed to assist individuals who struggle to decide what to eat, providing inspiration and guidance at mealtimes.  

Key Features:
Feature 1: Error handling, e.g. Displays error messages when users enter incorrect times or invalid selections. 

Feature 2: Time-Based Suggestions, e.g. Offers different meal suggestions for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; taking into account the user's inputted time. 

Feature 3: Meal Suggestions, e.g. Provides users with a list of meal ideas based on the time of day, dietary preference and ingredient availability. 

Feature 4: Buttons Are Time Coded, e.g. Each button has a certain time range which assits the user with their meal suggestion for morning, afternoon and night. 

These features aim to provide a convenient app that guids and inspires with meal suggestions. 

4. Design Considerations
------------------------

Design Consideration:

The design of the "MEAL SUGGESTION APP" was based on the following key considerations: 

User Experience (UX): The app was designed with the goal of providing the user with a simple platform or application that will assist them with meal suggestions when clueless on what to eat.  

Responsiveness: The app was built to ensure it performs well when any input time is done and a certain button is clicked to suggest the meal, by giving a quick response of various meals. 

Simplicity: The design is simple and ensures that users can easily find and access meal suggestions through inputting the time of day and clicking the button aligned with that button, e.g. 1000 for breakfast button. 

Performance: The app performs and runs well with no bugs.


5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------
GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

GitHub Actions:
This project was managed using GitHub for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly for the "MEAL SUGGESTION APP" application. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity. 

GitHub Actions:
I utilized GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. This includes: 
I ran an automated build.yml test to validate the functionality of the application and ensure no errors or bugs. 
Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.


6. Screenshots and App Demo

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

Challenges and Learnings
During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

Challenge 1: Implementing a time input text was challenging after I had coded my buttons to display meal suggestions without a time input box or text. 

Solution: I added a EditText box to use as my time input and coded each button to have time range of meal suggestions when time is inputted and the button is clicked 

Challenge 2: Pushing my code on GitHub. 

Solution : Instead of pushing the code on Android Studio, I used commands to push th code to GitHub. 

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions. 


8. Future Enhancements
----------------------

Future Enhancements
While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including: 

Feature 1: Adding screens to my app, which will allow the user to see a different screen when the button to suggest a meal is clicked. 

Feature 2: Images to display the meal options that will be suggested by the app. 

Feature 3: Nutritional Information; displays nutritional information, such as calories, macronutrients, and allergens for each meal suggestion. 

These enhancements would improve the appâ€™s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
